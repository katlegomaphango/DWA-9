# DWA_09.3 Challenge 1

## Project Description
In this Challenge, you will continue with your [“Book Connect”](https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-8) codebase, and further iterate on your abstractions.
Previously, you worked on adding abstraction around the book preview functionality of the project. Next, you must turn the book preview abstraction into a fully-working web component. Then, apply the techniques you’ve learned about this module to the book preview.

If you are up for it, you can also convert other aspects of the app into web components.

You will have a call with your coach where you highlight the following:

- What problems did you encounter converting the book preview to a component?
- What other elements make sense to convert into web components? Why?
- Why does keeping your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file sometimes make sense?

## Getting Started:
1. Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-9.git
```
2. Run localhost server
3. Open index.html
